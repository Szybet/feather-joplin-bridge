# feather-joplin-bridge
A CLI app that allows to "Bridge" / Convert Notes between lightweight C++ Qt Based [FeatherNotes](https://github.com/tsujan/FeatherNotes) and heavy Electron [Joplin](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin) to get the best of both worlds out of all devices (Even an [E-reader](https://github.com/Szybet/FeatherNotes-inkbox)...)

### Minor notes
`export_html` contains a simple app to export all embedded images into a directory and replacing them with paths. Good to use if the file gets too big, so loading takes a long time and the app freezes. This part was written by ChatGPT, it works but it's not the best code.
